# DayType

DayType is a simple package that provides a type to manage a Day. A day being the same as a date but without any concept of time or timezone. The 'DMY' if you like. The package provides the core `Day` type as well as extensions and support types such as `DayComponents`. All of which are modelled off the standard `Date` and `DateComponents` with the intent of make `Day` identical apart from loosing the time parts. As a consequence this also means that unlike `Date` which represents a specific point in time that has different times in different timezones, `Day` represents a single day in a calendar that does not change in relation to a change in timezone. This makes it ideal for not only representing a date without time, but also for deal with date references which "float" across time zones.
